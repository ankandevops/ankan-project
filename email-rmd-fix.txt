Hi Team,

While trying to install the runner for the RMD project on the VM, I encountered the following error during execution:

csharp
Copy
Edit
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/latest  
The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.
This seems related to a network or TLS-level issue. Could you please help check:

Whether TLS 1.2 is enabled on the VM?

If there are any network/firewall rules blocking outbound HTTPS traffic to github.com?

If the VM is behind a proxy, do we need to configure proxy settings in PowerShell?

Let me know if you need any logs or further details.
