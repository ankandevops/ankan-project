Subject: Proposal to Consolidate Staging and Production Pipelines – RMD Project

Hi [Client's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

For the RMD project, I’ve currently created separate pipelines for each environment. However, after a discussion with Sri, we explored an idea that could improve the deployment process.

We’re considering having a single pipeline that includes:

One shared build job, and

Two separate deployment jobs — one for Staging and one for Production.

Each deployment job would have its own approval gate, ensuring proper validation and control before promotion to the next environment.

This approach can help us streamline the process, reduce duplication, and make the overall pipeline easier to maintain.

Please let us know your thoughts or if you'd like to schedule a quick call to discuss this in more detail.

Best regards,
Ankan Biswas
