Once the deployment is successfully completed, it's critical to verify the applicationâ€™s health, accessibility, and performance. This section outlines how to validate the deployment using Azure DevOps logs, application endpoints, and Azure Monitor (Application Insights).

âœ… 1. Azure DevOps Deployment Logs
After running the deployment pipeline in Azure DevOps, ensure that the final deployment stage completes successfully.

Navigate to your pipeline in Azure DevOps.

Check the last job/stage (e.g., "Azure App Service Deploy" or "ARM Template Deployment").

Look for âœ“ Job succeeded confirmation.

âœ… 2. Application Endpoint Validation
Verify that the application is live and responsive:

Access the application via the public URL:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://yourapp.azurewebsites.net
If a health check endpoint is available, validate it:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://yourapp.azurewebsites.net/health
You can also test via cURL or browser.

bash

curl -I https://yourapp.azurewebsites.net/health

âœ… 3. Application Insights â€“ Live Monitoring
If Application Insights is configured, validate real-time metrics:

Navigate to your App Service in Azure Portal.

Open Application Insights â†’ Live Metrics Stream.

Confirm:

Incoming requests are being captured

No recent failures or exceptions

Average response time is within expected range
